Async in script tag in JavaScript is a way to load scripts asynchronously.

> That means, if a script is async, it will be loaded independently of other scripts on the page,
and will not block the page from loading.


> If you have a page with several external scripts, loading them all asynchronously can speed up the page load time,
because the browser can download and execute them in parallel.

> To use async, simply add the async attribute to your script tag:
<!-- <script async src="script.js"></script> -->



> By using the defer attribute in HTML, the browser will load the script only after parsing (loading) the page.

> This can be helpful if you have a script that is dependent on other scripts,
or if you want to improve the loading time of your page by loading scripts after the initial page load.

> To use defer, simply add the defer attribute to your script tag:
<!-- <script defer src="script.js"></script> -->

<!-- Difference between async and defer -->
> The async and defer attributes both allow the browser to continue parsing the HTML document while JavaScript files are
being downloaded, but they differ in when those files are executed.

> Async downloads and executes JavaScript as soon as itâ€™s available, while defer attribute waits until the HTML document
has been parsed before downloading and executing any external scripts.
